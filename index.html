  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
    30 years old.<br />
    2 years ago I got into Photography to explore my creative side, for the most part I got into landscape, nature and street Photography<br />
    In april 2021 i started to explore the idea of learning front-end devolopment with my sights on one day becoming a full-stack developer,<br />
    I am learning this all on my free time by doing a course on Udemy and exploring on my own, I already have a few ideas for future projects to learn more. <br />
    The current plan is to try and make myself my own photography/portfolio website when I have touched into CSS and JS as I feel I weill need to practise those hands on before advancing further.<br />
    This personal site/CV is under current development and will get better over time as I progress and learn more.
